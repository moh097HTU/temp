  # CLASS FILTERING
  # ===========================================
  # Filter which classes to detect. Options:
  #   - null or omit: detect ALL classes
  #   - list of names: ["human"], ["human", "drone"], etc.
  #   - list of IDs: [0], [0, 2], etc.
  #   - "all": detect all classes
  # 
  # Examples:
  #   filter_classes: null           # All classes
  #   filter_classes: ["human"]      # Only humans
  #   filter_classes: ["human", "drone"]  # Humans and drones
  #   filter_classes: [0, 2]         # By class ID
  filter_classes: ["person"]  # Only detect persons (COCO class)
  
  # Class name to ID mapping for your custom model
  # This maps friendly names to YOLO class IDs
  # For COCO pretrained model: person=0, car=2, truck=7, etc.
  # For your custom model: human=0, vehicle=1, drone=2
  class_names:
    0: "person"     # COCO: person
    #2: "car"        # COCO: car
    #7: "truck"      # COCO: truck
    # Uncomment below for your custom model:
    # 0: "human"
    # 1: "vehicle"
    # 2: "drone"

# Target processing rate
